Description: High-throughput DNA sequencing enables detection of copy number variations
    (CNVs) on the genome-wide scale with finer resolution compared to array-based methods,
    but suffers from biases and artifacts that lead to false discoveries and low sensitivity.
    We describe CODEX2, a statistical framework for full-spectrum CNV profiling that is 
    sensitive for variants with both common and rare population frequencies and that is
    applicable to study designs with and without negative control samples. We demonstrate
    and evaluate CODEX2 on whole-exome and targeted sequencing data, where biases are the
    most prominent. CODEX2 outperforms existing methods and, in particular, significantly
    improves sensitivity for common CNVs.
